# HTML Tags Edited:
    - Changed <div class="header"> to <header>
    - Changed the <div> containing the Navigation links to <nav> 
    - Changed <div class="content"> to <main class="content">
    - Added Alt Tags to the three images housed within the <main> content
    - Changed the primary div for the sidebar to <aside>
    - Added Alt Tags to the three icons in the <aside> section


# CSS Changes:
    - Changed .header div rules to .header nav (for both ul and li)
    - Added additional effects to header. Position Fixed and a box-shadow
    - Added a tag rules specifically for the nav links including a:hover effect
    - Separated CSS sections with comments for easier navigation
    - Combined multipe CSS classes that shared exact same rules in the Main Content and Aside sections


# Other Changes:
    - Formated all images to 72dpi, saved as .pngs and optimized them for the web to reduce their file sizes

# Additional Notes:
    - In my experience the h1 tag should not be in the header nor be used only for the company name. But seeing as there was no content in the Hero section, I left it as is.
    - The ![code refactor demo](./Assets/01-html-css-git-homework-demo.png) image file does not incldue a footer. But I see no reason why it shouldn't.
